# Attendance System using Computer Vision 

This project is an Attendance System built using Computer Vision, specifically employing techniques like face detection and recognition. The system is designed to automate the process of taking attendance, eliminating the need for manual tracking and reducing human error. It can be used in various settings such as schools, colleges, offices, and other institutions where attendance management is required.

## Requirements
To use this Attendance System, the following requirements must be met:

* Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org.
* OpenCV: The system relies on the OpenCV library for image processing tasks. Install OpenCV by running the following command:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

* Dlib: The Dlib library is used for face detection and facial landmarks. Install Dlib using the following command:

```
pip install dlib
```
* Face Recognition: The Face Recognition library is required for face recognition tasks. Install it by running the following command:

```
pip install face_recognition
```

* NumPy: NumPy is used for numerical operations. Install it with the following command:

```
pip install numpy
```

## How to Use
Follow these steps to use the Attendance System:

* Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

* Ensure all required libraries are installed (see Requirements section).
